# ===================================
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.City officials have a number of questions on the program, so the first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Analysis
The Tableau workbook is saved as NYC 2018 CitiBike Data Analysis.twbx and the data used for this workbook is in the folder Data can be found in the name of nybike_2018_data.csv

As for this Project Tableau Public has been used and that limits the data to 15,000,000 after processing the file I dicided to filter the data using the "Age" field" so data so, that amount of the data can be restricted to the max limit. For 2018 data I have taken the "Age" field from 16 to 51.
